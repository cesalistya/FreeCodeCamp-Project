        <header>Java Programming Language</header>
        <p>Java is one of the most popular and widely used programming language.
          <ul>
            <li>Java has been one of the most popular programming language for many years.</li>
            <li>Java is Object Oriented. However it is not considered as pure object oriented as it provides support for primitive data types (like int, char, etc)</li>
            <li>The Java codes are first compiled into byte code (machine independent code). Then the byte code runs on Java Virtual Machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying architecture.</li>
            <li>Java syntax is similar to C/C++. But Java does not provide low level programming functionalities like pointers. Also, Java codes are always written in the form of classes and objects.</li>
            <li>Java is used in all kind of applications like Mobile Applications (Android is Java based), desktop applications, web applications, client server applications, enterprise applications and many more.</li>
            <li>When compared with C++, Java codes are generally more maintainable because Java does not allow many things which may lead bad/inefficient programming if used incorrectly. For example, non-primitives are always references in Java. So we cannot pass large objects (like we can do in C++) to functions, we always pass references in Java. One more example, since there are no pointers, bad memory access is also not possible.</li>
            <li>When compared with Python, Java kind of fits between C++ and Python. The programs written in Java typically run faster than corresponding Python programs and slower than C++. Like C++, Java does static type checking, but Python does not.</li>
          </ul>

        <h4>Simple Hello World Program :</h4>
        <code>
          <pre>
            // A Java program to print "Hello World" 
            public class GFG { 
                public static void main(String args[]) 
                { 
                    System.out.println("Hello World"); 
                } 
            }</pre>

      <section class="main-section" id="Java_Identifier">
        <header>Java Identifier</header>
        <p>
          In programming languages, identifiers are used for identification
          purposes. In Java, an identifier can be a class name, method name,
          variable name, or label. For example :
        </p>
        <code>
          <pre>
                public class Test { 
                     public static void main(String[] args){
                         int a = 20; }
                }
            </pre
          >
        </code>
        <p>In the above java code, we have 5 identifiers namely :</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Test</strong> : class name.</li>
          <li><strong>main</strong> : method name.</li>
          <li><strong>String</strong> : predefined class name.</li>
          <li><strong>args</strong> : variable name.</li>
          <li><strong>a</strong> : variable name.</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="main-section" id="Data_Types_in_Java">
        <header>Data types in Java</header>
        <p>Java has two categories of data :</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Primitive Data Type</strong>: such as boolean, char, int,
            short, byte, long, float, and double
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Non-Primitive Data Type or Object Data Type</strong> : such
            as String, Array, etc.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="data_type">
          <h4>Primitive Data Type</h4>
          <p>
            Primitive data are only single values and have no special
            capabilities. There are <strong>8 primitive data types</strong>:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>boolean</strong> : boolean data type represents only one
              bit of information either true or false, but the size of the
              boolean data type is virtual machine-dependent. Values of type
              boolean are not converted implicitly or explicitly (with casts) to
              any other type. But the programmer can easily write conversion
              code.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>byte</strong> : The byte data type is an 8-bit signed
              two’s complement integer. The byte data type is useful for saving
              memory in large arrays.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>short</strong> : The short data type is a 16-bit signed
              two’s complement integer. Similar to byte, use a short to save
              memory in large arrays, in situations where the memory savings
              actually matters.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>int</strong> : It is a 32-bit signed two’s complement
              integer.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>long</strong> : The long data type is a 64-bit two’s
              complement integer.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>float</strong> : The float data type is a single-precision
              32-bit IEEE 754 floating-point. Use a float (instead of double) if
              you need to save memory in large arrays of floating-point numbers.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>double</strong> : The double data type is a
              double-precision 64-bit IEEE 754 floating-point. For decimal
              values, this data type is generally the default choice.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>char</strong> : The char data type is a single 16-bit
              Unicode character.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <code>

          <h4>Non-Primitive Data Type or Reference Data Types</h4>
          <p>
            The Reference Data Types will contain a memory address of variable
            value because the reference types won’t store the variable value
            directly in memory. They are strings, objects, arrays, etc.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong class="non_primitive">String</strong> : Strings are
              defined as an array of characters. The difference between a
              character array and a string in Java is, the string is designed to
              hold a sequence of characters in a single variable whereas, a
              character array is a collection of separate char type entities.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong class="non_primitive">Class</strong> : A class is a
              user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are
              created. It represents the set of properties or methods that are
              common to all objects of one type. In general, class declarations
              can include these components, in order:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Modifiers</strong>: A class can be public or has
                  default access (Refer this for details).
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Class name</strong>: The name should begin with a
                  initial letter (capitalized by convention).
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Superclass(if any)</strong>: The name of the class’s
                  parent (superclass), if any, preceded by the keyword extends.
                  A class can only extend (subclass) one parent.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Interfaces(if any)</strong>: A comma-separated list of
                  interfaces implemented by the class, if any, preceded by the
                  keyword implements. A class can implement more than one
                  interface.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Body</strong>: The class body surrounded by braces, {
                  }.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong class="non_primitive">Object</strong>: It is a basic unit
              of Object-Oriented Programming and represents the real-life
              entities. A typical Java program creates many objects, which as
              you know, interact by invoking methods. An object consists of :
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>State</strong>: It is represented by attributes of an
                  object. It also reflects the properties of an object.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Behavior</strong>: It is represented by methods of an
                  object. It also reflects the response of an object with other
                  objects.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Identity</strong>: It gives a unique name to an object
                  and enables one object to interact with other objects.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong class="non_primitive">Interface</strong>: Like a class, an
              interface can have methods and variables, but the methods declared
              in an interface are by default abstract (only method signature,
              nobody).
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Interfaces specify what a class must do and not how. It is the
                  blueprint of the class.
                </li>
                <li>
                  An Interface is about capabilities like a Player may be an
                  interface and any class implementing Player must be able to
                  (or must implement) move(). So it specifies a set of methods
                  that the class has to implement.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If a class implements an interface and does not provide method
                  bodies for all functions specified in the interface, then the
                  class must be declared abstract.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A Java library example is, Comparator Interface. If a class
                  implements this interface, then it can be used to sort a
                  collection.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong class="non_primitive">Array</strong>: An array is a group
              of like-typed variables that are referred to by a common name.
              Arrays in Java work differently than they do in C/C++. The
              following are some important points about Java arrays.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  In Java, all arrays are dynamically allocated. (discussed
                  below)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Since arrays are objects in Java, we can find their length
                  using member length. This is different from C/C++ where we
                  find length using size.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A Java array variable can also be declared like other
                  variables with [] after the data type.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The variables in the array are ordered and each has an index
                  beginning from 0.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Java array can be also be used as a static field, a local
                  variable or a method parameter.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The size of an array must be specified by an int value and not
                  long or short.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The direct superclass of an array type is
                  <strong class="non_primitive">Object</strong>.
                </li>

        <header>Variables in Java</header>
        <p>
          A variable is a name given to a memory location. It is the basic unit
          of storage in a program.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The value stored in a variable can be changed during program
            execution.
          </li>
          <li>
            A variable is only a name given to a memory location, all the
            operations done on the variable effects that memory location.
          </li>
          <li>In Java, all the variables must be declared before use.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We can declare variables in java as follows:</p>
        <p>
          <strong>type</strong>: Type of data that can be stored in this
          variable.
        </p>
        <p><strong>name</strong>: Name given to the variable.</p>
        <p>
          In this way, a name can only be given to a memory location. It can be
          assigned values in two ways:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Variable Initialization</li>
          <li>Assigning value by taking input</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="type_variables">
          <h4>Types of variables</h4>
          <p>There are three types of variables in Java :</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Local Variables</strong>: A variable defined within a
              block or method or constructor is called local variable.
            </li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                These variable are created when the block in entered or the
                function is called and destroyed after exiting from the block or
                when the call returns from the function.
              </li>
              <li>
                The scope of these variables exists only within the block in
                which the variable is declared. i.e. we can access these

              <strong>Instance Variables</strong>: Instance variables are
              non-static variables and are declared in a class outside any
              method, constructor or block.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  As instance variables are declared in a class, these variables
                  are created when an object of the class is created and
                  destroyed when the object is destroyed.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Unlike local variables, we may use access specifiers for
                  instance variables. If we do not specify any access specifier
                  then the default access specifier will be used.

                <li>
                  These variables are declared similarly as instance variables,
                  the difference is that static variables are declared using the
                  static keyword within a class outside any method constructor
                  or block.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Unlike instance variables, we can only have one copy of a
                  static variable per class irrespective of how many objects we
                  create.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Static variables are created at the start of program execution

                  If we access the static variable like Instance variable
                  (through an object), the compiler will show the warning
                  message and it won’t halt the program. The compiler will
                  replace the object name to class name automatically.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If we access the static variable without the class name,
                  Compiler will automatically append the class name.
                </li>
                <p>
                  To access static variables, we need not create an object of

        <header>Operators in Java</header>
        <p>
          Java provides many types of operators which can be used according to
          the need. They are classified based on the functionality they provide.
          Some of the types are :
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Arithmetic Operators:</strong> They are used to perform
            simple arithmetic operations on primitive data types.
            <ul>
              <li><b>*</b> : Multiplication</li>
              <li><b>/</b> : Division</li>
              <li><b>%</b> : Modulo</li>
              <li><b>+</b> : Addition</li>
              <li><b>-</b> : Subtraction</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Unary Operators:</strong> Unary operators need only one
            operand. They are used to increment, decrement or negate a value.
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>– :Unary minus</strong>, used for negating the values.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>+ :Unary plus</strong>, indicates positive value
                (numbers are positive without this, however). It performs an
                automatic conversion to int when the type of its operand is
                byte, char, or short. This is called unary numeric promotion.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>++ :Increment operator</strong>, used for incrementing
                the value by 1. There are two varieties of increment operator.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>— : Decrement operator</strong>, used for decrementing
                the value by 1. There are two varieties of decrement operator.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>! : Logical not operator</strong>, used for inverting a
                boolean value.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Assignment Operator: ‘=’</strong> Assignment operator is
            used to assign a value to any variable. It has a right to left
            associativity, i.e value given on right hand side of operator is
            assigned to the variable on the left and therefore right hand side
            value must be declared before using it or should be a constant.<br />
            In many cases assignment operator can be combined with other
            operators to build a shorter version of statement called Compound
            Statement. For example, instead of a = a+5, we can write a += 5.
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>+=</b>, for adding left operand with right operand and then
                assigning it to variable on the left.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>-=</b>, for subtracting left operand with right operand and
                then assigning it to variable on the left.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>*=</b>, for multiplying left operand with right operand and
                then assigning it to variable on the left.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>/=</b>, for dividing left operand with right operand and then
                assigning it to variable on the left.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>%=</b>, for assigning modulo of left operand with right
                operand and then assigning it to variable on the left.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <code>
              <pre>variable = value;</pre>
            </code>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Relational Operators:</strong> These operators are used to
            check for relations like equality, greater than, less than. They
            return boolean result after the comparison and are extensively used
            in looping statements as well as conditional if else statements.
            General format is,
            <code>
              <pre>variable <b>relation_operator</b> value</pre>
            </code>
            Some of the relational operators are-
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>==, Equal to</strong>: returns true if left hand side is
                equal to right hand side.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>!=, Not Equal to</strong>: returns true if left hand
                side is not equal to right hand side.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong><, less than</strong>: returns true if left hand side is
                less than right hand side.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong><=, less than or equal to</strong>: returns true if left
                hand side is less than or equal to right hand side.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>>, Greater than</strong>: returns true if left hand side
                is greater than right hand side.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>>=, Greater than or equal to</strong>: returns true if
                left hand side is greater than or equal to right hand side.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Logical Operators:</strong> These operators are used to
            perform “logical AND” and “logical OR” operation, i.e. the function
            similar to AND gate and OR gate in digital electronics. One thing to
            keep in mind is the second condition is not evaluated if the first
            one is false, i.e. it has a short-circuiting effect. Used
            extensively to test for several conditions for making a decision.
            Conditional operators are-
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>&&, Logical AND</strong>: returns true when both
                conditions are true.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>||, Logical OR</strong>: returns true if at least one
                condition is true.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Ternary Operator:</strong> Ternary operator is a shorthand
            version of if-else statement. It has three operands and hence the
            name ternary. General format is- <br />
            <code>condition ? if true : if false</code><br />
            The above statement means that if the condition evaluates to true,
            then execute the statements after the ‘?’ else execute the
            statements after the ‘:’.
            <code>

            <strong>Bitwise Operators:</strong> These operators are used to
            perform manipulation of individual bits of a number. They can be
            used with any of the integer types. They are used when performing
            update and query operations of Binary indexed tree.
            <ul>
